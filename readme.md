FARR_TinyEV
===========

Developer readme
----------------

I used MinGW to build the DLL -- `mingw32-make` should get you a DLL if all goes well.

End user readme
---------------

FARR_TinyEV is a plugin for the fantastic Find and Run Robot launcher utility and the almost equally fabulous Everything file indexer.

To install, copy the Farr_TinyEV directory into your FARR plugin directory and make FARR reload the plugins.

There's a fairly self-documented initialization file in the directory, as well.

Good luck!

Source license
--------------

The source and plugin are offered as-is, with no formal license for the parts I've written.

* `everything_ipc.h` is from the Everything SDK.
* `JrPluginFuncs*.h` are from the FARR SDK.
